# About me and this site

Hi! I'm Zoltán Béla Kiss (hence the domain, "KZB" is my initials in hungarian).
I'm a 24-year-old zoomer who is passionate about photography and even more-so about film photography.

On this page you'll find the images of my photography portfolio and some technical details to go along with them.
I also have a not-so-regularly updated collection of articles on the different pieces of equipment I use if you are into that sort of thing.

If you have any questions or remarks feel free to send me an e-mail here: [kzoltanbela@gmail.com](mailto:kzoltanbela@gmail.com)
